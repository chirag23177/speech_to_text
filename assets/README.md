# Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets for the Real-Time Speech Translator application.

## Structure:
- `images/` - Icons, logos, and other images
- `sounds/` - Audio files for notifications (if needed)
- `fonts/` - Custom fonts (if needed)

## Current Status:
The project currently uses Font Awesome CDN for icons, so no local icon files are needed yet.

Future assets may include:
- Custom microphone icons
- Loading animations
- Sound effects for recording start/stop
- Custom branding images
