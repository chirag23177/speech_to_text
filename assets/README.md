# Icon Placeholder

This directory should contain the application icons:

- `icon.png` - Main application icon (512x512)
- `icon.ico` - Windows icon file
- `icon.icns` - macOS icon file

For now, the application will work without these files, but you should add proper icons for a professional appearance.

You can create icons using online tools like:
- https://www.canva.com/create/logos/
- https://favicon.io/
- https://app.logo.com/

Recommended sizes:
- PNG: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512
- ICO: Multiple sizes embedded
- ICNS: Multiple sizes embedded
