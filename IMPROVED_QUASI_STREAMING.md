# Improved Quasi-Streaming Fix

## Problem Identified
The previous implementation had audio chunks that were too small (~16KB) for Google Cloud to reliably detect speech. Google Cloud Speech-to-Text needs sufficient audio duration (2-3 seconds minimum) to work effectively.

## Solution Implemented

### Key Changes:
1. **Chunk Accumulation**: Collect 2+ chunks before processing (2-3 seconds of audio)
2. **Timer Backup**: Process every 3 seconds automatically as backup
3. **Better Status**: Clear indication of what the app is doing
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Avoid adding the same text multiple times

### How It Works Now:
1. **Record 1-second chunks** (for responsiveness)
2. **Accumulate 2-3 chunks** (for sufficient audio)
3. **Process combined audio** (2-3 seconds total)
4. **Display results immediately**
5. **Auto-translate new text**

### User Instructions:
1. Click "Start Recording"
2. **Speak for 2-3 seconds** in clear phrases
3. **Pause briefly** to let processing happen
4. **Continue speaking** - new text will be added
5. Click "Stop" when done

### Expected Behavior:
- Status: "Recording - speak for 2-3 seconds for recognition..."
- UI shows: "ðŸŽ¤ Listening... Speak clearly for 2-3 seconds"
- After speaking 2-3 seconds: "Processing speech..."
- Then: Text appears and gets translated automatically

### Troubleshooting:

**If no text appears:**
1. **Speak longer** - need 2-3 seconds minimum
2. **Speak louder** - ensure microphone picks up audio
3. **Check microphone** - ensure browser has permissions
4. **Wait 3 seconds** - timer will trigger processing

**If text is repeated:**
- Fixed: Added duplicate detection to prevent repetition

**If processing seems stuck:**
- Timer backup processes every 3 seconds automatically

### Testing:
1. Run the app
2. Click "Start Recording"
3. Say: "Hello, this is a test of the transcription system." (speak for 3-4 seconds)
4. Wait 1-2 seconds
5. Should see: Text appears, then translation
6. Continue with: "This should work much better now." (another 3-4 seconds)
7. Should see: New text added, new translation

### Technical Details:
- **Minimum Audio**: 2 chunks = ~2 seconds
- **Processing Timer**: Every 3 seconds backup
- **Chunk Overlap**: Keep last chunk for continuity
- **Status Feedback**: Clear user guidance
- **Error Handling**: Clear chunks on errors

This should now provide reliable quasi-real-time transcription!
