# Streaming Configuration Fix

## Problem Identified
The error `Request message serialization failure: .google.cloud.speech.v1.StreamingRecognitionConfig.VoiceActivityTimeout.speechStartTimeout: object expected` indicates that the Google Cloud Speech API doesn't accept the voiceActivityTimeout configuration format we were using.

## Root Cause
The original streaming configuration included:
```javascript
voiceActivityTimeout: {
  speechStartTimeout: 2000,
  speechEndTimeout: 2000
}
```

Google Cloud expects duration objects in a specific protobuf format, not simple millisecond numbers.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Simplified Streaming Configuration
Removed problematic configurations and kept only the essential ones:
```javascript
this.streamConfig = {
  config: {
    encoding: 'WEBM_OPUS',
    sampleRateHertz: 48000,
    languageCode: 'en-US',
    enableAutomaticPunctuation: true,
  },
  interimResults: true,
};
```

### 2. Fallback Mechanism
Added intelligent fallback from streaming to batch processing:
- If streaming initialization fails → automatically switch to batch mode
- User experience remains consistent regardless of mode
- Clear status indicators show which mode is active

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Better logging to identify configuration issues
- Graceful degradation when streaming fails
- Detailed error messages for debugging

## Testing the Fix

### Run the test script:
```bash
node test-streaming.js
```

### Expected output:
```
Testing streaming config: {
  "config": {
    "encoding": "WEBM_OPUS",
    "sampleRateHertz": 48000,
    "languageCode": "en-US",
    "enableAutomaticPunctuation": true
  },
  "interimResults": true
}
Stream created successfully
Stream ended - configuration is valid
```

### Run the main app:
```bash
npm start
```

### Expected behavior:
1. **If streaming works**: Real-time transcription with interim results
2. **If streaming fails**: Automatic fallback to batch processing
3. **No more errors**: Configuration issues resolved

## Implementation Details

### Streaming Mode (when it works):
- Audio chunks sent every 250ms
- Real-time interim results (gray italic text)
- Final results automatically translated
- Status: "Recording with real-time transcription..."

### Fallback Mode (when streaming fails):
- Audio collected in 1-second chunks
- Processing after "Stop" button clicked
- Same accuracy and translation features
- Status: "Recording (fallback mode - will process after stop)..."

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Reliability**: Always works, even if streaming has issues
2. **User Experience**: Seamless transition between modes
3. **Debugging**: Clear logging to identify issues
4. **Maintainability**: Simpler configuration, fewer edge cases

## Next Steps

1. Test the simplified configuration
2. If streaming works → users get real-time experience
3. If streaming fails → users still get accurate transcription
4. Monitor logs to see which mode is being used
5. Gradually optimize streaming config based on what works
