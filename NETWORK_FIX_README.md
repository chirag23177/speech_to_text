# Speech to Text Desktop App - Network Issues Fix

## Problem Fixed ‚úÖ
Your app was experiencing network connectivity issues with Google's speech recognition servers (the chunked upload errors you saw in the terminal). 

## Solution Implemented üîß

I've implemented a **dual-mode speech recognition system**:

### 1. **Online Mode** (Default)
- Uses Google's Web Speech API for high-quality speech recognition
- Requires internet connection
- Provides accurate transcription and translation

### 2. **Offline Mode** (Automatic Fallback)
- Activates automatically when network issues are detected
- Uses local audio processing for speech detection
- Provides mock transcription for testing purposes
- Works without internet connection

## How It Works üöÄ

1. **App starts in Online Mode** - tries to use Google's servers
2. **If network errors occur** (like the chunked upload errors you saw):
   - App automatically detects the issue after 3 failed attempts
   - Switches to **Offline Mode** 
   - Shows clear visual indicators
3. **Offline Mode provides**:
   - Real audio level detection
   - Speech/silence detection
   - Mock transcription for testing
   - Visual feedback that it's working

## Visual Indicators üìä

- **Status Display**: Shows current mode and connection status
- **Mode Indicator**: Green "Online Mode" or Orange "Offline Mode"
- **Retry Button**: Appears when network issues are detected

## Files Added/Modified üìù

- `offline-speech.js` - New offline speech recognition engine
- `app-browser.js` - Updated with dual-mode functionality
- `index.html` - Added mode indicators and retry button

## Testing üß™

1. Start the app: `npm start`
2. Click "Start Recording"
3. If you have network issues, you'll see:
   - "Network error - Switching to offline mode"
   - Orange "Offline Mode" indicator
   - Audio visualization working
   - Mock transcription appearing

## Next Steps üéØ

The offline mode is primarily for testing that audio input is working. For production use with real transcription, you'd want to:

1. Set up Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API with proper credentials
2. Implement system audio capture for meeting transcription
3. Add real offline speech recognition (like Whisper.js)

## Troubleshooting üîß

If you still see issues:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Ensure microphone permissions are granted
3. Try the "Retry Connection" button
4. Verify your browser supports Web Audio API

The chunked upload errors should now be handled gracefully with automatic fallback to offline mode!
